A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.4 that makes campfire creation more immersive and interactive! Instead of instant crafting, experience a satisfying multi-step process that feels natural and rewarding.

## ✨ Features

### 🪓 The Chopping Stump
- Craft a **Stump** from 3 logs in a row
- Place any log on the stump by right-clicking
- Right-click again to **chop** the log into 4 firewood pieces

### 🪵 Firewood Stacking
- Place firewood on the ground
- Stack up to **4 firewood pieces** - they arrange like real campfire logs
- Uses authentic campfire log dimensions and textures

### 🔥 Lighting the Fire
- Once you have 4 firewood stacked, right-click with **coal or charcoal**
- This creates an **Unlit Campfire** ready to be ignited
- Use **Flint and Steel** (or Fire Charge) to light it
- Transforms into a vanilla campfire!
